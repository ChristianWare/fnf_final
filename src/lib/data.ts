It begins with a two-week discovery sprint where we analyze your workflows, compliance requirements, and system architecture. From there, we design a bespoke solution that may include HIPAA-compliant medical intake forms, multi-tenant role hierarchies, enterprise SLA hosting, or integrations into complex ERP/CRM ecosystems. With enterprise monitoring and 24/7 support, you’ll get guaranteed uptime and priority response times. Best for hospital networks, multinational rental groups, or enterprise franchises where a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work.
